# ZooYorkTimes Scraper :newspaper::apple::statue_of_liberty:
A `NodeJS`, `MongoDB`, `Express`, and `ReactJS` application where users can query, display, and save articles from the [New York Times Article Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/). Users can remove saved articles as well.

**Live Demo**: https://zooyorktimes-scraper.herokuapp.com/

## Functionality
On the backend, the app uses `express` to serve routes and `mongoose` to interact with a `MongoDB` database.

On the frontend, the app uses `ReactJS` for rendering components, `axios` for internal/external API calls, and `bootstrap` as a styling framework.

In order to transpile the JSX code, `webpack` and `babel` were utilized. All of the JSX  code in the `/app` folder was transpiled into the `bundle.js` file located in the `/public` folder.

## New York Times API
Prior to starting this app and getting an `unnecessary` error message, you'll probably want to swap out the API Key provided in the `client/src/utils/API.js` file.

## Quickstart

```
  git clone git@github.com:wrainaud/ZooYorkTimes-Scraper.git my-app
  cd my-app
  yarn install
  cd client
  yarn install
  cd ..
  yarn start
  # API server will listen on http://localhost:3002 by default
```

## Quickstop

```
  ^C
  ^C
```

**Note : Please make sure your MongoDB is running.** For MongoDB installation guide see [this](https://docs.mongodb.org/v3.0/installation/). 
Run the following command in Terminal to start MongoDB after installation
```
  brew services start mongodb-community@4.4
```

Run the following command in Terminal to stop MongoDB
```
  brew services stop mongodb-community@4.4
```

Also `npm3` is required to install dependencies properly.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Mongo connection error ECONNREFUSED: Make sure MongoDB is running (see commands above). By default the app connects to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/nytreact. You can override this via the MONGODB_URI environment variable.
- API returns 503 Database unavailable: This means MongoDB is not connected. Start Mongo or set MONGODB_URI to a reachable instance; the API will serve static assets and other routes meanwhile.
- Client error "No such module: http_parser": Modern Node versions (>=20) removed the legacy `http_parser` native binding required by very old webpack-dev-server versions used by CRA 1.x. To keep dev startup working on modern Node, this projectâ€™s start script now builds the React app (npm run build) and serves static assets from Express instead of running the legacy dev server.
- Something is already running on port 3000: The React development server defaults to port 3000. Stop any process using that port or set a different port before starting the client, e.g. PORT=3002 yarn start. The provided start script defaults the client to 3002 if PORT is not set.
- Mongoose module errors like "Cannot find module './types/embedded'" or deprecation warnings for `open()` usually indicate mixed or stale installs. Fix by removing top-level node_modules and client/node_modules, then reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules client/node_modules && yarn install && (cd client && yarn install)`.
